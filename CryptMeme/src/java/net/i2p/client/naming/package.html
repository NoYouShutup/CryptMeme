<p>Provides a standard way for querying the local naming service to resolve a
name into a {@link net.i2p.data.Destination} (without the complexity of JNDI).  
The default implementation is a simple hosts.txt driven system, though that can
be overridden by specifying the "i2p.naming.impl" environment property to point
at the requested classname.</p>
