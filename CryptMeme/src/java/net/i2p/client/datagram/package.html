<p>Provides a standard way for reading and writing messages transferred over I2P
so that the recipient has an authenticated mechanism to reply to it.  This is
necessary because the base I2P message sent through {@link net.i2p.client.I2PSession#sendMessage}
has no "from" address, and simply providing a raw "from" address would be 
insecure as it could be spoofed.  An application that needs to know for certain 
who sent a message to them should use the {@link net.i2p.client.datagram.I2PDatagramDissector} 
to parse the raw message received from the {@link net.i2p.client.I2PSession}, and 
in turn, use the {@link net.i2p.client.datagram.I2PDatagramMaker} to build a 
message that can be parsed. </p>

<p>The datagram format implemented here includes
the sender's {@link net.i2p.data.Destination}, the payload, and a hash of the 
payload (signed by the sender's {@link net.i2p.data.SigningPrivateKey}).</p>
