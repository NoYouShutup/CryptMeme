The Invisible Internet Client Protocol (I2CP) allows applications simplified access to
the I2P network without requiring them to deal with the issues involved with the
Invisible Internet Network Protocol (I2NP). Specifically, it defines the wire level
protocol as well as semantics for the messages passed between clients and the router
for communicating with the router over bidirectional TCP/IP sockets. I2CP does not
specify how the client libraries are created, what APIs they expose to applications, or
even what language they're written in.
</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
I2CP requires that the client can access the router over bidirectional TCP sockets. In
nearly all cases, these connections will be over to the local machine.
</p>
<h2>Threat Model</h2>
<p>
I2CP does not provide data confidentiality or handle lossy connections beyond what
TCP has built in. For this reason, I2CP really should only be run between clients and
routers on the same machine or over trusted networks. Secured I2CP transports may
be added in the future. I2CP however does not expose any private keys across the
wire - proof of authorization to collect messages for a Destination is provided by
public key signatures.

<h1>Messages</h1>
<p>
These classes are the currently defined messages in the Invisible Internet Client
Protocol (I2CP), though common data structures are located in the I2P Common Data
Structure Specification. For simplicity, all I2CP messages begin with the same
structure, though that structure is not listed below. Specifically, all I2CP messages
transmitted begin with a 4 byte Integer specifying the entire size of the current
message's body (the body being what's specified below), followed by a 1 byte
Integer specifying the type of message (the id field below), after which the rest of
the message is formatted according to the type of message, as specified below.
</p><p>
If there is a fatal error causing either the client or the router to desire to cancel sending
a message part way through, it should drop its connection. Administrative sessions are
not stateful (aka each administrative message from client to router must provide
authentication), but normal client sessions are stateful and survive disconnects. Client
sessions expire when either the client sends a DestroySessionMessage or the router
times out the session according to its own configurable timer. If a client sends any
message other than a CreateSessionMessage when there is no valid session, the
router must reply with a SessionStatusMessage specifying that the session is not
valid.

I2P Data Structures Spec.
