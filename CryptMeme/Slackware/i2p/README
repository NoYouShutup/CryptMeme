The I2P package will be installed to /opt/i2p.

To install to another location, set the variable INSTALL_DIR in i2p.SlackBuild
and rebuild the package.


Installing and Upgrading:
=========================

I2P has an auto-update function but generally speaking packages are managed by
packaging systems. Changing a package's files outside of the package system can
cause problems. To upgrade when there's a new I2P release, retrieve the new
source, re-run the SlackBuild, then use upgradepkg to update.

To ignore all this and upgrade "in-network", simply change the permissions of the installation
directory (/opt/i2p by default). Something like the following would suffice:

    chown -R USERNAME /opt/i2p


Starting and using I2P
======================

Using the initscript
--------------------

To start I2P at boot, set the executable bit on /etc/rc.d/rc.i2p, add this
script to rc.local*, and set the variable "RUN_AS_USER" in /etc/rc.d/rc.i2p.

Optionally, create a new user/group with limited rights to run I2P.

Something like the following would work to start I2P at system boot, running under the
"i2p" account:

     echo '[ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.i2p ] && /etc/rc.d/rc.i2p start' >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local
     echo '[ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.i2p ] && /etc/rc.d/rc.i2p stop' >> /etc/.rc.d/rc.local_shutdown
     sed -i .bak 's/^.*\(RUN_AS_USER\)=.*/\1=i2p/' /etc/rc.d/rc.i2p
     chmod 755 /etc/rc.d/rc.i2p

Unless running as a user named "i2psvc", I2P's config directory defaults to
$HOME/.i2p. In the case of the "i2psvc" user, the default config directory is
/var/lib/i2p/i2p-config.

It should not need to be said that using the "root" account is not recommended.

When running using the initscript, I2P will write its logs to /var/log/i2p.

Starting I2P "on-demand"
------------------------

As with a normal installation, I2P can be started with "i2prouter start". The
i2prouter and eepget scripts hve been installed to /usr/bin so they'll be
accessible in the default system PATH.

When running using the i2prouter script, I2P will write its logs to $HOME/.i2p.


Configuring your browser
------------------------

In order to access eepSites (I2P-internal web sites) your web browser needs to
be configured. Set the HTTP Proxy to 127.0.0.1 and port 4444. For more information, see
https://geti2p.net/en/about/browser-config

The I2P router console is reachable at http://127.0.0.1:7657.


Addressbook subscriptions
-------------------------

Please see the FAQs at http://i2p-projekt.i2p/faq or https://geti2p.net/faq for information about
the various addressbook services.


Chatting on IRC
---------------

I2P comes preconfigured with a tunnel pointing to the I2P-only IRC network,
Irc2P.  Signing on is easy, just connect to 127.0.0.1 on port 6668. Do not
configure a proxy in your IRC client.
