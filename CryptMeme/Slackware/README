Getting the sources
===================

Monotone
--------

The bleeding-edge source code is available both within and outside of I2P. The
I2P project uses Monotone to maintain the codebase.

Information on retrieving the source with monotone is available within I2P at
http://i2p-projekt.i2p/monotone and from the internet at https://geti2p.net/monotone.

Monotone 1.0 Slackbuilds are available at http://slackbuilds.org/.

Git
---

Git is also an option to retrieve the I2P source code. That said, the I2P
Monotone servers are *the* authoritative source.

Public Git repositories hosting the I2P source and managed by I2P project team members include

- https://github.com/i2p/i2p.i2p
- http://git.repo.i2p/w/i2p.i2p.git (mirrored from Github)
- http://sourceforge.net/p/i2p/code/


Tarball
-------

The latest stable release is always available from the I2P homepage at
https://geti2p.net/get/.


This SlackBuild
===============

Requirements
-------------

The following are needed to build the i2p package:

* jre >= 6
* jdk >= 6
* gettext
* apache-ant >= 1.7.1

If you don't care about bundling the translations, the gettext requirement can
be avoided by adding -Drequire.gettext=false to the ant lines in
i2p/i2p.SlackBuild

A JRE >= v6 is the only requirement to run I2P.

Building
--------

As the root user, run either $I2PSRC/Slackware/i2p/i2p.SlackBuild or `ant slackpkg` to create a package
in $I2PSRC/Slackware/i2p which can be installed using the Slackware packaging tools.
