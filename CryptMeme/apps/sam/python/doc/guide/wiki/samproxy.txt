Title: SAM proxy

A '''SAM proxy''' is run by the I2P router.  The proxy allows streams, datagrams, and raw packets to be sent through the I2P network.  A client application uses a telnet-like session to communicate with the proxy.  In this way, the core features of the I2P library can be used by any language.

The protocol used for SAM is described in [http://dev.i2p.net/pipermail/i2p/2004-July/000353.html SAM 1.0].

In practice, a ''SAM library'' is usually written, so that client applications do not need to use the low-level SAM commands.
