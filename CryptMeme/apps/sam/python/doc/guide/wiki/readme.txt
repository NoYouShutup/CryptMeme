The documentation was created by using MediaWiki software.

This directory houses the wiki text sources.

Feel free to move to any other documentation system, if
it is efficient and easy to maintain.

The documentation made by epydoc is pretty nice.

Ideally, one could patch epydoc to use a more condensed
2-column format (where there are fewer pages, and it is
easier to read).

With a little work on the output, epydoc could then be
used solely for documenting this project.

Note that the docs produced by epydoc are huge.
