Title: User's Guide:i2p.tunnel

Module <code>i2p.tunnel</code> allows data to be exchanged between traditional TCP sockets and I2P sockets.

== Tunnels ==

Tunnels allow stream sockets to be joined, so that connections to a listening socket are relayed to one or more sending sockets.  This allows an ordinary web server to be exposed as an I2P Destination, or an I2P Destination to be bound as a local port, and so on.

class '''Tunnel'''(self, receive, make_send, nconnect=-1, timeout=60.0)
<ul><pre>
 A Tunnel relays connections from a 'receive' socket to one
 or more 'send' sockets.  The receive socket must be bound
 and listening.  For each incoming connection, a new send
 socket is created by calling make_send().  Data is then
 exchanged between the created streams until one socket is
 closed.  nconnect is the maximum number of simultaneous
 connections (-1 for infinite), and timeout is the time that
 a single connection can last for (None allows a connection
 to last forever).
 
 Sockets must accept stream traffic and support the Python
 socket interface.  A separate daemonic thread is created to
 manage the tunnel.  For high performance, make_send() should
 make a socket and connect in non-blocking mode (you should
 catch and discard the i2p.socket.BlockError or socket.error due to
 executing connect on a non-blocking socket).
 
 Security Note:
 A firewall is needed to maintain the end user's anonymity.
 An attacker could keep a tunnel socket open by pinging it
 regularly.  The accepted sockets from 'receive' must prevent
 this by closing down eventually.
 
 Socket errors do not cause the Tunnel to shut down.
</pre></ul>

'''close'''()
<ul>
 Close all connections made for this tunnel.
</ul>

=== Tunnel Server ===

class '''TunnelServer'''(session, port, samaddr='127.0.0.1:7656', nconnect=-1, timeout=None, **kwargs)
<ul><pre>
 Tunnels incoming SAM streams --> localhost:port.
 
 nconnect and timeout are the maximum number of connections
 and maximum time per connection.  All other arguments are
 passed to i2p.socket.socket().  This call blocks until the
 tunnel is ready.
</pre></ul>

'''TunnelServer''' properties:
<ul><pre>
 dest       - I2P Destination of server. 
 session    - Session name for server.
</pre></ul>

=== Tunnel Client ===

class '''TunnelClient'''(session, port, dest, samaddr='127.0.0.1:7656', nconnect=-1, timeout=None, **kwargs)
<ul><pre>
 Derived from Tunnel.
 Tunnels localhost:port --> I2P Destination dest.
 
 A session named 'session' is created locally, for purposes
 of routing to 'dest'.  nconnect and timeout are the maximum
 number of connections and maximum time per connection.  All
 other arguments are passed to i2p.socket.socket().  This call
 blocks until the tunnel is ready.
</pre></ul>

'''TunnelClient''' properties:
<ul><pre>
 dest       - Local Destination used for routing.
 remotedest - Remote Destination.
 session    - Session name for local Destination.
</pre></ul>
