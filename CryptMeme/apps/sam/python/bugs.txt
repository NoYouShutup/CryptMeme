Known Bugs:
  * tunnel.TunnelServer may crash the I2P router when a 20+ MB file
    is downloaded at 200+ KB/s (only possible with local downloads).
  * Errors raised for sockets are non entirely consistent.
    See todo.txt for how to fix this.
  * A session does not close until a program exits.
    This should be fine once I2P is patched to allow multiple
    programs to use a single session at once.
  * i2p.router.start() does not work.

Fixed Bugs:
  * Large downloads are no longer corrupted (fixed by jrandom in I2P
    core).
  * Datagram packets are no longer lost, for a local server and
    client (fixed by jrandom in I2P core).
