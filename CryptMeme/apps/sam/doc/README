The Simple Anonymous Messaging protocol provides a way for
client applications to communicate anonymously over I2P without 
having to deal with the complexities of I2CP.  More information can
be found at http://www.i2p.net/sam and a comparison of the various
client access techniques is up at http://www.i2p.net/applications

There are a few SAM libraries available in this package, as well as
a Java implementation of the SAM bridge.
