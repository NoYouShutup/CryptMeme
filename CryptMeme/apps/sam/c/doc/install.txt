How to Install LibSAM
=====================

1) Be sure you have GNU Make installed.

2) Find the Makefile for your operating system in the LibSAM root.  For example,
if you are on FreeBSD, you'd use Makefile.freebsd.

3) Run gmake with the -f option to build LibSAM.  For example, on FreeBSD, you'd
run "gmake -f Makefile.freebsd".  On Linux, GNU Make is just called 'make', so
you'd run "make -f Makefile.linux".

4) If that worked, you can now try to compile some of the example programs.
They are compiled in the same way as LibSAM, but the Makefile names are
different.

I2P-Ping should compile on any Unix system using the default Makefile.  It won't
work on Win32, however, because Win32 doesn't have the getopt() function.

The Warhammer example should run on any OS.  Use the Makefile.posix for Unix
sytems or the Makefile.mingw for Win32.

*** If you have trouble ***

If you have trouble compiling LibSAM, try to edit the Makefiles to fix the
problem.  The "Makefile.common" is shared by all systems, and you shouldn't have
to touch it.  Just copy the Makefile of the OS most similar to your own and
start hacking on it.  Send me a patch if you get it working.

I realise this build system is horrible, and in the future I will probably
replace it entirely.
