sam-sharp


DESCRIPTION

  sam-sharp is a .NET SAM client library for I2P written in C#. It aims to be
  compatible with platforms that implement .NET's base class library API (such
  as Mono and DotGNU Portable.NET) and to be usable from all languages
  conforming to the ECMA-standardized Common Language Infrastructure, including
  C# and VB.NET.


MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS

  * Mono and mcs 1.0 or higher (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows)

         - or -

    MS .NET Framework SDK 1.0 or higher (Windows)

         - or -

    DotGNU Portable .NET, latest version recommended (*BSD, AIX, Cygwin, Linux,
    Mac OS X, MinGW, Solaris)


OPTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

  * NAnt 0.85 or higher is needed to use sam-sharp.build. Sorry, NAnt does not
    yet support Portable.NET.

  * NUnit 2.2.1 or later is needed to run the (soon-to-be-added) unit tests. If
    you have the Mono mcs package installed then you already have NUnit.


DOCUMENTATION

  Pre-generated docs will be submitted to CVS soon. In the meantime you may
  generate standalone documentation from the embedded XML doc comments by
  issuing the following commands from sam-sharp's src/ directory:

    Mono:

      mkdir ../doc
      mcs -doc:../doc/sam-sharp_doc.xml *.cs

    MS .NET:

      mkdir ../doc
      csc /doc:../doc/sam-sharp_doc.xml *.cs

    DotGNU Portable.NET:

      mkdir ../doc
      csdoc -o ../doc/sam-sharp_doc.xml *.cs

  The resulting XML doc can be converted to HTML using either Visual Studio .NET
  (Tools > Build Comment Web Pages) or Portable.NET's csdoc2html tool:

    csdoc2html -o ../doc ../doc/sam-sharp_doc.xml
