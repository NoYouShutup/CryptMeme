Old Jetty 5 classes for multipart form requests, moved to susimail and modded when we moved to Jetty 6,
then moved from susimail to jetty-i2p.jar when we needed them in the router console also.
As of 0.9.19.
Not a public API, not for direct use.
These are requirements for net.i2p.servlet.RequestWrapper.
