<p>Implementation of a TCP-like (reliable, authenticated, in order) set of sockets for 
communicating over the IP-like (unreliable, unauthenticated, unordered) I2P
messages.

This is the streaming implementation (moved for ticket #1135 to here). 
For the API (which you probably want), see ministreaming. 
Clients should not need to access anything in this package directly.
Use the interfaces and factory in net.i2p.streaming.

Note that this class is split across two jars, streaming.jar and ministreaming.jar.
The interfaces and some code are in ministreaming.jar, but the
real work gets done in streaming.jar. Clients must have both jars
in their classpath.

Most clients will require (only) streaming.jar, ministreaming.jar, and i2p.jar
in their classpath to communicate with the router.
