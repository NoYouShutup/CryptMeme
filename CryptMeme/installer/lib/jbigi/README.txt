================================

jbigi.jar was built by jrandom on Aug 21, 2004 with the jbigi and jcpuid 
native libraries compiled on linux, winXP (w/ MinGW), and freebsd (4.8).  
The GMP code in jbigi is from GMP-4.1.3 (http://www.swox.com/gmp/), and 
was optimized for a variety of CPU architectures.

On Sep 16, 2005, libjbigi-osx-none.jnilib was added to jbigi.jar after
being compiled by jrandom on osx/ppc with GMP-4.1.4.

On Sep 18, 2005, libjbigi-linux-athlon64.so was added to jbigi.jar after
being compiled by jrandom on linux/p4 (cross compiled to --host=x86_64)
with GMP-4.1.4.

On Nov 29, 2005, the libjbigi-osx-none.jnilib was added back to
jbigi.jar after being mistakenly removed in the Sep 18 update (d'oh!)

On Dec 30, 2005, the libjcpuid-x86-linux.so was updated to use the 
(year old) C version of jcpuid, rather than the C++ version.  This removes
the libg++.so.5 dependency that has been a problem for a few linux distros.

On Feb 8, 2006, the libjbigi-linux-viac3.so was added to jbigi.jar after
being compiled by jrandom on linux/p4 (cross compiled to --host=viac3)

On Feb 27, 2006, jbigi-win-athlon.dll was copied to jbigi-win-athlon64.dll,
as it should offer amd64 users better performance than jbigi-win-none.dll
until we get a full amd64 build.

================================

Updates May/June 2011:
  jcpuid:
   - jcpuid.c updated to be compatible with -fPIC
   - 32 bit libjcpuid-linux-x86.so updated, compiled with -fPIC.
   - 64 bit libjcpuid-linux-x86_64.so added, compiled with -fPIC.
   - 32 bit libjcpuid-freebsd-x86.so updated, compiled with -fPIC.
   - 64 bit libjcpid-freebsd-x86_64.so added, compiled with -fPIC.
   - 32 bit libjcpuid-x86-solaris.so added, compiled with -fPIC.
   - 32 bit jcpuid-x86-windows.dll updated (no PIC for Windows).
   - 64 bit jcpuid-x86_64-windows.dll was added.
   - See also javadoc and code in CPUID.java
  jbigi:
   - k62 and k63 are identical for all except windows; exception added to
     NativeBigInteger to use k62 for k63. k63 files deleted.
   - All 32 bit linux files updated with GMP 4.3.2, compiled with -fPIC,
     except for athlon64 and pentium4, which use GMP 5.0.2.
   - All 64 bit linux files updated with GMP 5.0.2.
   - All 32 bit freebsd files updated with GMP 4.3.2, compiled with -fPIC.
   - All 64 bit freebsd files are new and were linked with GMP 5.0.2.
   - All previously existing windows files were updated with GMP 4.3.2. Just as was
     done for the non-windows architectures, files for 64 bit CPUs were 
     linked with GMP 5.0.2.
   - jbigi-windows-athlon64.dll was updated, it used to be duplicate of
     jbigi-windows-athlon.dll. 
   - jbigi-windows-*_64.dll are new and were compiled with the x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
     cross compiler 4.5.3 in Linux and linked with GMP 5.0.2.
   - Note that all new 64 bit files will use the _64 suffix. For example,
     the old libjbigi-linux-athlon64.so file was 64 bit; now it is 32 bit
     and the 64 bit file is libjbigi-linux-athlon64_64.so.
   - The 4.3.2 files are half the size of the 5.0.2 files, and there was
     little or no performance difference for 32 bit, so we are using
     4.3.2 for 32 bit. For 64-bit processors, both performance testing and
     the GMP changelog led us to use 5.0.2 for both the 32- and 64-bit versions.
