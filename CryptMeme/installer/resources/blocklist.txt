# If you have a 'split' directory installation, with configuration
# files in ~/.i2p (Linux) or %APPDATA%\I2P (Windows), be sure to
# edit the file in the configuration directory, NOT the install directory.
# When running as a Linux daemon, the configuration directory is /var/lib/i2p
# and the install directory is /usr/share/i2p .
#
# The file in the install directory will be overwritten when you update I2P.
# As of release 0.9.18, the router reads and merges the files in the install directory
# and the config directory. Additionally, if the advanded configuration
# router.blocklist.file=/path/to/otherlist.txt is set, this file will be
# read in and merged as well.
#
# If there is no blocklist.txt file in the configuration directory, create it and
# add entries as desired.
#
#
# Blocking is enabled by default.
# To disable blocking, set router.blocklist.enable=false on configadvanced.jsp.
#
# Add additional entries as desired, sorting not required.
# This file is only read at router startup.
# To manually block a router after startup, use the form on http://127.0.0.1:7657/configpeer.jsp
# Warning - a large list will increase memory usage.
# Please do not block too broadly, it will segment and harm the network.
# For example, http://www.bluetack.co.uk/config/splist.zip is very broad and includes Tor users, it is not recommended.
# A more reasonable list: http://www.bluetack.co.uk/config/level1.zip
# Note: bluetack blocklists now require a subscription. See https://forum.transmissionbt.com/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=15652
#
# We have included the bogons from http://www.team-cymru.org/Services/Bogons/http.html ,
# but you will have to update your blocklist manually if the bogon list changes.
# You must update this list yourself, it is not overwritten by the update process.
