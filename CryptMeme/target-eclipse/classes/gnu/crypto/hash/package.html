WARNING - DEPRECATED - Use SHA256Generator.getDigestInstance() to get a
MessageDigest that will be faster in almost all cases.
</p><p>
This is the old GNU SHA-256 Hash implementation.
It is deprecated and mostly unused, unless the java.security.MessageDigest
implementation for SHA-256 is not available in the JVM.
And it always should be, right?
Do not instantiate this directly - use I2PAppContext.sha().
See net.i2p.crypto.SHA256Generator for more information and test results.
