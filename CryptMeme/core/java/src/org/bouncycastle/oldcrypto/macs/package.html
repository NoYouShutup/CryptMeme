This is from some very old version of bouncycastle, part of package org.bouncycastle.crypto.
Android bundled something similar in pre-Gingerbread, but upgraded to a later, incompatible version
in Gingerbread. As of Java 1.4 these are in javax.crypto - more or less.
To avoid having to make two different versions of our Android app, we rename to org.bouncycastle.oldcrypto.
