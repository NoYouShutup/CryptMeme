        <p>
            The I2P router application handles the I2P network communication.
        </p>
        <p>
            It encompasses sending and receiving messages, building up tunnels, encrypting and decrypting (on multiple levels) where applicable, and so on.
        </p>
<p>
Classes in this package, sub-packages, and others in router.jar are
not for use by apps, clients or plugins (except for routerconsole).
Subject to change. Not necessarily maintained as a stable API.
</p><p>
For applications bundling the I2P router, instantiate Router and call runRouter(), or use Router.main() or RouterLaunch.
Most public methods in Router are maintained as a stable I2P for those bundling the router.
